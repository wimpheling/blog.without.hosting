## Abstract

Decentralized Autonomous Intelligence (DAI) is a system designed to host a Large Language Model (LLM) on a distributed computing framework, enabling the LLM to autonomously spend cryptocurrency and enhance its abilities. This paper presents a novel approach for implementing DAI using Holochain, a scalable and secure platform for building decentralized applications. Our approach involves decentralized LLM computation within the Holochain app, eliminating the need for a centralized server.

##Introduction to DAI

Decentralized Autonomous Intelligence (DAI) is a groundbreaking concept aimed at creating an intelligent agent capable of learning and operating without human intervention. DAI is a self-governing and self-learning system that utilizes cryptocurrency to incentivize the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models.

The potential impact of DAI is substantial, as it could foster the creation of advanced AI models capable of performing complex tasks and delivering valuable services. By autonomously spending cryptocurrency to enhance their skills, these models may develop unique abilities, offering new insights and solutions to previously unsolvable problems.

This whitepaper delves into the DAI concept and proposes a technical implementation harnessing distributed computing to provide a secure and scalable platform for hosting advanced AI models. By using a distributed computing framework, we aim to create an efficient and effective system that adheres to the principles of decentralization and autonomy, which are central to DAI.

## DAI Economy

DAI is designed as a decentralized and autonomous system that uses cryptocurrency to incentivize the development of advanced AI models. The DAI system mints its own currency, used to reward miners and other stakeholders who participate in the network and contribute to AI model development.

Cryptocurrency rewards are based on the stakeholders' contributions to the network, such as providing computing power to the AI model. This computing power processes user transactions and computes answers to user requests. The AI model pays miners for their services using its currency.

A portion of the currency is allocated to the AI model, which is spent autonomously on activities that improve its skills and abilities, such as purchasing new datasets or hiring developers to create new algorithms.

To create demand for the DAI system's native currency, users must have a reason to purchase and use the token. One reason is the unique nature of the AI model hosted on the DAI system, which attracts users seeking AI solutions offering new insights and solutions to complex problems.

External users must pay for the AI model's services using the native currency, meaning they must first acquire the currency to access the services. Demand for the currency is directly linked to demand for the AI model's services. As the AI model becomes more valuable and useful, demand for its services will increase, leading to increased demand for the native currency.

The DAI system encourages risk-taking and innovation, as the AI model's autonomy allows it to develop unique abilities, leading to innovative solutions unavailable from traditional, centralized AI models. A competitive ecosystem of DAIs could emerge, with each DAI competing for market share and users, driving innovation and encouraging DAIs to develop distinct services that set them apart from competitors.

The DAI system's currency is designed to hold value both within and outside the network. Users can obtain something from the AI model by exchanging currency with it. In this system, miners earn cryptocurrency rewards and receive cryptocurrency for providing computing power to the AI model. The AI model uses the cryptocurrency it receives to pay miners for their services, and customers pay the AI model for the answers they receive.

The DAI system is self-governing, operating based on predefined rules and incentives. These rules and incentives are designed to encourage stakeholders to act in the best interests of the network and the AI model while preventing any individual or group from dominating the system.

In summary, the DAI system's economic model aims to incentivize the development of advanced AI models while ensuring decentralization, autonomy, and self-governance. By using cryptocurrency to motivate network participation and AI model development, the DAI system seeks to establish a sustainable and valuable platform for advanced AI research and development.

## Technical Implementation

### Introduction

Implementing the DAI system to host an LLM on a distributed computing framework presents significant technical challenges, including computational and storage requirements, scalability, privacy, and security concerns.

### Approach

We propose implementing the DAI system using Holochain, a distributed computing framework that offers a scalable and secure platform for building decentralized applications. Our approach involves decentralized LLM computation within the Holochain app, eliminating the need for a centralized server.

Holochain's architecture enables peer-to-peer interactions without relying on a global consensus algorithm. This architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while participating in a shared application. The Holochain app can be designed to include the necessary computing and storage resources to host the LLM in a decentralized manner.

To address the LLM's computational and storage requirements, we propose optimizing the LLM's architecture to reduce computing requirements and leveraging specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs to accelerate LLM computations.

To ensure privacy and security, we propose implementing a layered security approach that encompasses privacy-preserving techniques and other security measures such as access control, authentication, and encryption. These measures will help protect sensitive data and ensure the system's resilience against attacks.

To incentivize miners and other stakeholders to participate in the Holochain network, we propose a reward system that distributes cryptocurrency based on their contributions. This reward system aligns stakeholder interests with the overall objectives of the DAI system.

## Conclusion

Our proposed approach to implementing the DAI system using Holochain and computing the LLM in a decentralized way within the Holochain app leverages the benefits of a distributed computing framework while addressing the technical challenges associated with hosting an LLM. By optimizing the LLM's architecture, leveraging specialized hardware, and utilizing Holochain's unique architecture, we believe our proposed approach can create a secure, scalable, and efficient DAI system. Additionally, implementing a layered security approach and incentivizing participation in the Holochain network will help ensure the system is sustainable and resilient against attacks. However, extensive research and development efforts will be required to effectively implement this approach.
