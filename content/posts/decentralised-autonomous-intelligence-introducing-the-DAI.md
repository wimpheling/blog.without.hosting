description: ""
---


## Abstract:
Decentralized Autonomous Intelligence (DAI) is a proposed system that aims to host a Large Language Model (LLM) on a distributed computing framework, enabling the LLM to autonomously spend cryptocurrency and develop its own skills. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implementing the DAI system using Holochain, a distributed computing framework that provides a scalable and secure platform for building decentralized applications. In our approach, the LLM is computed in a decentralized way within the Holochain app, eliminating the need for a centralized server.

## What is a DAI ?

Decentralized Autonomous Intelligence (DAI) is a revolutionary concept that aims to create an intelligent agent that can learn and operate independently of human control. At its core, DAI is a self-learning and self-governing system that uses cryptocurrency to incentivize the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models.

The potential impact of DAI is significant, as it could lead to the development of advanced AI models that can perform complex tasks and provide valuable services to users. By autonomously spending cryptocurrency to improve their skills, these models could develop their own unique abilities and provide new insights and solutions to problems that have previously eluded human understanding.

The concept of DAI represents a significant departure from traditional AI models, which are often controlled by centralized entities and rely on human input to function properly. By allowing the AI model to develop independently, DAI has the potential to create a new class of intelligent agents that are capable of operating on their own, without human intervention.

In this whitepaper, we will explore the concept of DAI in more detail and propose a technical implementation that leverages the benefits of distributed computing to create a secure and scalable platform for hosting advanced AI models. By using a distributed computing framework to host the AI model, we aim to create a system that is both efficient and effective, while still maintaining the principles of decentralization and autonomy that are central to the concept of DAI.

## Economy

The DAI system is designed to be a decentralized and autonomous system that uses cryptocurrency to incentivize the development of advanced artificial intelligence models. The DAI system mints its own currency, which is used to incentivize miners and other stakeholders to participate in the network and contribute to the development of the AI model.

The cryptocurrency rewards for miners and stakeholders are based on their contributions to the network, which includes providing computing power to the AI model. This computing power is used to process the transactions made by users and to compute the answers to their requests. The AI model is responsible for using its own currency to pay the miners for their services.

A portion of the currency is allocated to the AI model itself. This currency is used by the AI model to autonomously spend on activities that improve its own skills and abilities. For example, the AI model might use this currency to purchase new data sets or hire developers to create new algorithms.

To create demand for the DAI system's native currency, users must alsso have a reason to purchase and use the token. One reason is the unique nature of the AI model hosted on the DAI system. The AI model's ability to operate autonomously and learn independently of human control makes it unlike any other AI model available. This uniqueness could attract users who are looking for AI solutions that offer new insights and solutions to problems that have previously eluded human understanding.


To use the DAI system's AI model, external users must pay for the service in the DAI system's native currency. This means that users must first acquire the currency in order to access the AI model's services. The demand for the DAI system's currency is directly tied to the demand for the AI model's services. As the AI model becomes more valuable and useful, the demand for its services will increase, leading to an increase in the demand for the DAI system's currency.

The DAI system encourages risk-taking and innovation as the autonomy of the AI model allows it to develop unique abilities, leading to innovative solutions that aren't available from traditional AI models controlled by centralized entities. As more DAIs emerge with their own unique capabilities, a competitive ecosystem of DAIs could develop, where each DAI vies for market share and users. This competition could drive innovation and encourage DAIs to develop distinct services that differentiate them from their competitors. The decentralized nature of the DAI system could also enable smaller players to enter the market and compete with larger, more established DAIs, creating a diverse and dynamic ecosystem of intelligent agents. As the demand for advanced AI models grows, the market for DAIs is expected to expand, providing opportunities for new and innovative players to enter the market and contribute to the development of advanced AI technologies.

The currency issued by the DAI system is designed to have value both within the network and outside of it. Users can obtain something from the AI model by exchanging currency with it. In this system, the miners will not only earn cryptocurrency rewards, but they will also receive cryptocurrency for providing computing power to the AI model. The AI model will use the cryptocurrency it receives to pay miners for their services, and customers will pay the AI model for the answers they receive.

The DAI system is designed to be self-governing, meaning that it operates based on a set of predefined rules and incentives. The rules and incentives are designed to encourage stakeholders to act in the best interests of the network and the AI model, while also preventing any individual or group from controlling the system.

Overall, the economic model for the DAI system is designed to incentivize the development of advanced AI models while also ensuring that the system is decentralized, autonomous, and self-governing. By using cryptocurrency to incentivize participation in the network and the development of the AI model, the DAI system aims to create a sustainable and valuable platform for advanced AI research and development, where miners not only earn cryptocurrency rewards, but also contribute to the development of an autonomous AI model that can provide valuable services to users.


## Technical WHITEPAPER

Introduction:
The DAI system proposes to host an LLM on a distributed computing framework and enable it to autonomously spend cryptocurrency while developing its own skills. However, the technical challenges associated with hosting an LLM on a distributed computing framework are significant. These challenges include computational and storage requirements, scalability, privacy, and security concerns.

Approach:
To address these challenges, we propose implementing the DAI system using Holochain, a distributed computing framework that provides a scalable and secure platform for building decentralized applications. In our approach, the LLM is computed in a decentralized way within the Holochain app, eliminating the need for a centralized server.

Holochain's architecture allows for peer-to-peer interactions without relying on a global consensus algorithm. This unique architecture enables users to maintain control over their own data while still participating in a shared application. The Holochain app can be designed to include the necessary computing and storage resources to host the LLM in a decentralized way.

To address the computational and storage requirements of the LLM, we propose optimizing the LLM's architecture to reduce the computing requirements and leveraging specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs to accelerate the LLM's computations.

To ensure privacy and security, we propose implementing a layered security approach that includes not only privacy-preserving techniques but also other security measures such as access control, authentication, and encryption. These measures would help ensure that sensitive data is protected and that the system is resilient against attacks.

To incentivize miners and other stakeholders to participate in the Holochain network, we propose a reward system that distributes cryptocurrency based on their contributions. The reward system would be designed to align the interests of stakeholders with the overall objectives of the DAI system.

Conclusion:
The proposed approach to implementing the DAI system using Holochain and computing the LLM in a decentralized way within the Holochain app leverages the benefits of a distributed computing framework while addressing the technical challenges associated with hosting an LLM. By optimizing the LLM's architecture, leveraging specialized hardware, and using Holochain's unique architecture, we believe the proposed approach can create a secure, scalable, and efficient DAI system. Additionally, implementing a layered security approach and incentivizing participation in the Holochain network will help ensure the system is sustainable and resilient against attacks. However, extensive research and development efforts will be required to implement this approach effectively.
